# Chest X-ray Classification Model with ResNet50

Welcome to the Chest X-ray Classification Model project! This model is trained to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: pneumonia or normal. Transfer learning using the ResNet50 architecture was employed to enhance the model's accuracy and efficiency.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training this model is available on Kaggle: [Labeled Chest X-ray Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tolgadincer/labeled-chest-xray-images).

## Model Training

The model training is implemented in the `trainer.py` notebook. Transfer learning with the ResNet50 pre-trained weights is applied to leverage the knowledge gained from a large dataset (ImageNet) for improved performance on the chest X-ray classification task.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and train the model using the provided notebook.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Training the Model
